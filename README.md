**Machine Learning in Quantum Physics**

>Machine learning could also be a significant application of quantum computing in the coming years, but challenges remain as near-term devices have a limited number of physical qubits and high error rates. Through this research article, we aim to highlight the machine learning aspects of quantum physics.

**System Analysis and Working of Magnetic Levitation Trains**

>This paper involves the layout, hardware, era, software and destiny makes use of “Magnetic levitation trains.” The maglev transportation machine is extra strong, quicker, financial, green.

**Space based Solar Power Fulfilling COP26: One Sun, One World**

>Space Based Solar Power is currently under intense research. Geosynchronous satellites collect sunlight, harness it to generate solar power, and transmit that power to Earth safely and reliably using Wireless power transmission (WPT). Via this paper we aim to highlight the aspects of this technology in the realiable energy sector.
